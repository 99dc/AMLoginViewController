AMLoginViewController
==================

I originally created this controller for a school project in order to deliver the coolest app possible. I hope this will be useful for other people.

NB: this is login view, so it's not supposed to be used a long time,  the big cpu use because of the blur effect processing shouldn't have a this important impact on the mobile's battery life.


I'm using 
- GPUImage Framework
- AVFundation Framework


You can disable blur effect in order to improve CPU use (from 50% to ~0%)
